            The hydrocarbon industry constitutes of Upstream, Midstream and
            Downstream sectors. Klengas caters to all three sectors for
            filtration and separation needs from Exploration & Production to Oil
            & Gas processing stations to refineries to petrochemicals to
            fertilizers.{" "}

          <p>
            Exploration & Production industry's primary applications are brine
            filtration and lube oil filtration. The brine is used for well
            completion and well work over. For formation protection, filtered
            brine down to 2 micron is a necessity. Along with fresh brine,
            re-circulated brine/produced water treatment is also a major
            application where filtration is pressed in to service. For all lube
            oil / hydraulic oil systems used in the rigs, a robust lube oil
            filtration systems, keeps the hydraulics running for longer times.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Oil & Gas Processing stations separate crude oil, produced water and
            associated gas from well fluid. The crude oil is further purified
            and made transportable to nearest refinery, the natural gas is
            dried, compressed and transported to either consumers or gas
            injection wells for tertiary EOR or Gas Turbine Power Generation
            plants. These stations use filtration for produced water, natural
            gas filtration, glycol filtration, amine filtration, process water
            and compressed air.{" "}

            Crude Oil Petroleum Refinery is the largest midstream industry. They
            focus on value generation from crude oil by utilizing the latest
            technologies of hydrocarbon separation. Klengas serves the refining
            applications such as amine sweetening unit, glycol dehydration unit,
            Water treatment plants, sour water treatment unit, diesel hydro
            desulphurization unit, hydro-treating unit etc.{" "}

          which in turn leads to carryover of amine and/or reduction in
          processing capacity of contactor. High efficiency and high volume
